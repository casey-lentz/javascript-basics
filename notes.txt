github(gitlab,bitbucket) = code repository management = centralized location of code
code repository management = many people working on the same project (agile)
When many people work on the same project there can be conflicts (people working on the same piece of code)

CREATING REPOSITORY
________________________________________________________________
1. create repository (and github account)
2. create local version of repository 
3. add files to repository locally - git clone [url]
4. make changes to any file in the repo
5. use git commands to add files to repository
  - git add [filename] or if more than one file [--all]
  - git commit -m '[your commit message describing what you did]'
  - git push to push all your work to github repository for all to see

GIT BRANCHING
----------------------------------------------------------------
each person can create a branch and make changes to whatever they want.
GIT COMMANDS = https://git-scm.com/docs/git
1.You can create a branch within github. (git checkout -b [branch name])
2. git checkout [branch name].
  - create edits.
  - use git commands noted above (git add,etc).
3. creating a pull request within github.
  - this is requesting code to go into another branch.
  - merge request usuall will go to a senior developer for review and merged.
  - merge conflicts are resolved in merge requests if conflicts happen.

  CONFLICTS
----------------------------------------------------------------
resolving merge conflicts
<<<<<<<<< [your branch name]
// your changes to resolve
======
// existing code to in repository.
>>>>>>>>>>>>> [branch your merging into].

make changes and commit and push back to your branch.
